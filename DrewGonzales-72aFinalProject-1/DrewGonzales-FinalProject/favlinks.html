            <p>Summary:  This list embodies my passion for innovative product design and its positive influence on society. These are the types of websites I go to to see the stnadards of what defines engineering, communities and the national societies that engineers have made for themselves that defines the standards of what is accetable and not accetable within the realms of product design, product innovation, engineering condudt standards and ethical treatment in the work place. I regularly go through this information so I can keep up with the latest engineering trends, publications and other useful info such as an engineering newsletter which will be beneficial for me in being able to work on innovative product design and product outcomes which I am incredibly patient about. By following these different links I find myself becoming a better engineer, designer and ultimately inventor of cool and interesting projects that I can do to benefit others.</p>
