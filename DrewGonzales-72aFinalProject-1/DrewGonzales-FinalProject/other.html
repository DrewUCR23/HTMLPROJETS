                <legend>Objective of Engineering And AI:</legend>
                <fieldset> <legend> Personal Connection: </legend><p> One of the main things that lead me to wanting to share this personal interest was that I want people to understand how change is mobilized in the world. My main interest has always been idea creation and idea creation. Naturally, Ive had a disposition towards entrepenuership, working and tinkering on many different ideas to solve difficult problems. One of the things I realized is that making content(information-products) does not lead to real solutions. People may cosume info-products(books, podcasts, well developed modules) but the consumption of information does not equal outcomes. It's dependent on the execution of that given information and the user being able to act accordingly. Furthermore, I was frustrated that anyone could design an info product within minutes and triviaize the work that I had put together in trying to design a comprehensive info product accordingly. Therefore, the initiative developed to start Engineering And AI(will be rebranded later) in order to represent my wider scope of interest to be a product-creating entreprenuer rather than an info-creating entreprenuer. Hopefully, with my divergent mind it is my hope that I will be able to develop amazing engineering products that people will enjoy. Above-all, these patent products and possible areas of advocacy should have high change,  maximum impact and progress society collectively.  My motivation  for sharing this personal interest is to show my immense creativity and desire to do interesting things. My future company Engineering and AI is simply a way to express my expansive mind...to help others! </p></fieldset>
                <p> The objective of Engineering and AI is to focus on innovative technology design in areas where technological advancement is either stagnating or there exist niches within technological sectors that may be rapidly grown. The primary areas of design exist in mental health products, nuclear fusion advocacy, and AGI development.</p>
                <ol class="objective-list">
                    <li>Picture one shows a possible mental Health band that could be developed to reduce the dependence on big Pharma for long-term solutions.</li>
                    <li>The next picture shows nuclear fusion as an area that needs greater funding resource allocation along with a greater focus to ensure sustainable energy and a breaking away from fossil fuels which promotes dependency on destructive resources rather than on constructive renewable resources.</li>
                    <li>AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) is another area that Engineering and AI concerns itself in the realms of research, innovation in expanding upon the transformer technology that led to the breakthrough in deep learning. Reference paper(Attention is all you need). Also, Engineering And AI is very much focused on alignment and assuring that ANI, AGI, and ASI deployments are properly aligned with the interests of humanity accordingly.</li>

                <h2>Theoretical Mental Headband</h2>
                
                <fieldset><legend>Personal Connection</legend><p>The main connection I have in relationship to this theoretical mental health headband is I have seen the challenges many people have with mental health. Specifically, myself I have dealt with problems with focus and ADHD for the majority of my life and I've never been particulary satisfied with the inferior treatment options that have been offered by the biopharmecutocal industry. My personal connection has been my own challenge with mental health which has effected my own life outcomes to live an undesirable life rather than a desirable life. Thus, a mental healthband like this that has the capacity to not depend on crutches from chemicals that cause heavy negative side-effects is desirable. In doing so, it would create a society in which people could live with unbounded upsides in terms of maximum benefit with bounded downsides in terms of constraining negative side-effects that effects peoples qualitiy of lfie. </p></fieldset> 
                <p>An innovative concept that combines neurotechnology with artificial intelligence. This mental headband would be designed to interpret brainwaves and translate them into actionable insights or commands.This could assist with conditions like ADHD, anxiety, depression, assist in dealing with hallucenations and more. This is just one idea I've had as I work on a patent design to invent and make. </p>

                <h2>Nuclear Fusion</h2>
                <fieldset><legend>Personal Connection:</legend><p>Nulear fusion has always been an Issue I've been passionate about because a transition from a Type 0 society --> Type 1 society is desirable.  A society in which we have renewable surplus of energy means we would exist in a post scarcity society where all of are basic needs would be met and we would no longer have to depend on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are inherently degenerate in terms of replacement and displacement of the natural ecological biosphere. Thus, my personal interest in this is the belief that it is our moral deontological duty to treat the environment sustainably and to assure we are good arbiters of the world. Thus, this extends to Engineering and AI because if I could assist in building a company that could exponentiate the progress of nuclear fusion we likely could reduce dramatically greenhouse emissions while providing  new green energy jobs for people who need employment. My personal connection and interest is inventing products and assisting   </p></fieldset>
                <p>Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus. It's the power source that fuels the sun and other stars. If harnessed properly, nuclear fusion can be a game-changer in providing clean and efficient energy for the world.</p>

                <h2>General Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <fieldset> <legend>Personal connection</legend><p>Ever since my early years, I've been deeply fascinated by the intersection of engineering and intelligence, both human and artificial. To me, AGI, or General Artificial Intelligence, represents the zenith of this intersection; it embodies the challenge of reproducing the vast, intricate fabric of human cognition and molding it into something revolutionary. My intrigue has always been twofold: Firstly, I've seen firsthand the transformative impact AI can have, and I've always dreamt of a world where machines comprehend and coexist harmoniously with humanity, contributing to our shared evolution. Secondly, on a more personal note, engineering and AI is more than just an interest - it's my passion. I believe in the potential of AGI to reinvent our world, and I've dedicated myself to being at the forefront of this wave, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and driving innovation that aligns with the best interests of humanity.</p></fieldset>
                <p>Unlike narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, general AI would have all the cognitive abilities of a human being. This means it can potentially perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It's one of the pinnacles of AI research and development.</p>
